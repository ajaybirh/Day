    <h1> Mother's Day 2024 </h1>
    <hr>
    
   
    <p>

        Mother began her mothership on May 7th 1996 7:55 pm. A glorious tuesday. Giving birth
        to an abomination we would later dub 'Tanu'. 

        <br>
        <br>

        <img src = "Tanuborn.png", alt = 'mom_smiling', class = "my-image">

        <br>
        <br>

        Mother quickly realized this was too much responsibility and would try to abandon Tanu
        in bushes as a last ditch effort. 

        <br>

        <img src = "Tanu_bush.png", alt = 'mom_smiling', class = "my-image">

        <br>
        <br>

        Somehow, Tanu seemed to always find her way back to the porch in a dog bed. Perhaps
        due to some demon entity

        <br>

        <img src = "dogbed.png", alt = 'mom_smiling', class = "my-image">

        <br>
        <br>

        After careful consideration, mother decided tanu was not enough. Here comes deepu. 
        Judging by my father's gaze, this would be a costly mistake
        
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>

        Now obviously its not good to end on a even number so my mother threw me in the mix
        to balance things out.
